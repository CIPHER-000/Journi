## 🔍 **Detailed Visual Mismatches**

### 1. Account/Upgrade Page - **CRITICAL MISMATCH** 🔴

**Screenshots Compared:**
- Current: `Current_Images/AccountPage1.png`
- Figma: `Figma_Images/AccountUpgrade page 1.png`

#### **Major Differences Identified:**

| Element | Current Implementation | Figma Design | Status |
