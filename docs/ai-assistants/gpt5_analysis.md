# Analysis of jobStatus Reset Issue in CreateJourneyPage.tsx

## Problem Description
The `jobStatus` state is being reset to `null` after successful form submission, preventing the JourneyProgress component from displaying even though the job starts successfully.

## Console Logs Evidence
1. **Job starts successfully**: "CreateJourneyPage: Job started successfully Object"
2. **Job status is set**: "CreateJourneyPage: Job status set, JourneyProgress should now display"
3. **But then jobStatus becomes null**: "CreateJourneyPage: Checking JourneyProgress display condition: {isSubmitting: true, jobStatus: null, jobStatusId: undefined}"

## Current handleSubmit Function Analysis

### Key State Management Issues:

1. **Line 184**: `setJobStatus(null)` - This clears any previous job status at the start of submission
2. **Line 279**: `setJobStatus(job)` - This sets the job status after successful API response
3. **Lines 323-328**: Finally block that resets `isSubmitting` if `!jobStatus`
4. **Lines 98-103**: `handleJobComplete` callback that sets `jobStatus` to null
5. **Lines 106-114**: `handleJobCancel` callback that sets `jobStatus` to null

### The Issue:
The problem seems to be in the **finally block (lines 323-328)**:

```typescript
finally {
  // Ensure isSubmitting is reset if job wasn't started
  if (!jobStatus) {
    setIsSubmitting(false)
  }
}
```

This code runs **asynchronously** after the state updates, but it's checking the `jobStatus` value from the **current closure**, not the updated state. Since `setJobStatus(job)` is asynchronous, the `jobStatus` variable in the finally block closure is still `null` when the check runs.

### Root Cause:
1. **State Update Asynchronicity**: `setJobStatus(job)` doesn't immediately update the `jobStatus` variable
2. **Closure Capture**: The finally block captures the `jobStatus` value from the time the try block started
3. **Race Condition**: The finally block runs before the state update completes

### Display Condition Logic (Lines 344-346):
```typescript
console.log('CreateJourneyPage: Checking JourneyProgress display condition:', { isSubmitting, jobStatus, jobStatusId: jobStatus?.id })
return isSubmitting && jobStatus
```

The component needs both `isSubmitting: true` AND `jobStatus` to be truthy to show the JourneyProgress.

## Potential Solutions:

### Solution 1: Use State Ref for Immediate Access
Create a ref that tracks the current jobStatus value for immediate access in the finally block.

### Solution 2: Restructure the Finally Block Logic
Remove the conditional logic from the finally block and handle state cleanup differently.

### Solution 3: Use a State Management Library
Use a more robust state management approach that can handle these asynchronous dependencies.

### Solution 4: Add Proper Error Boundaries and State Tracking
Implement better state tracking with proper error handling.

## Additional Concerns:
1. **Line 84**: The useEffect for retry also sets `jobStatus(null)` which could interfere
2. **Multiple State Updates**: Several state updates happening in sequence without batching
3. **Missing Loading States**: No clear indication of which phase of submission is failing

## Recommendation:
The most likely fix is to use a ref to track the current jobStatus value, or restructure the finally block to not depend on the asynchronous state update.
